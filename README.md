# MyProjects
The projects you will find in here are ones given to me by the Springboard Data Scientist course. There are a variety of topics that are covered within such as basic python data analysis, SQL data management, and a variety of machine learning application ( both suervised and unsupervised.) Larger projects can be found in the Capstone folder.
